# ZoneGate

ZoneGate is a security-first logistics authorization platform designed to support secure access and cargo handoff operations.

The web dashboard provides a centralized interface for monitoring authorization requests, reviewing personnel and courier access, analyzing security decisions, and managing operational policies and zones.

## Features

- Operations dashboard
- Authorization request monitoring
- APPROVE / HOLD / DENY decision tracking
- Courier and employee access directory
- Request and security statistics
- Location and operational zone monitoring
- Authorization policy configuration
- Security event and audit views
- Responsive web interface

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React
- Recharts
- Next.js App Router

## Running with Docker

Docker is the only prerequisite -- no Node, no npm.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The console is then on <http://localhost:3000>.

The console is a browser app: it calls the API from the visitor's browser, not
from the container. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` therefore has to be an address the
browser can reach, and Next inlines it **at build time** -- changing it means
rebuilding, not restarting:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.1.20:8000 docker compose up -d --build
```

The default, `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, is already correct when the backend is
running from its own compose file on the same machine.

### Tests

```bash
docker compose --profile tools run --rm test
```

43 unit tests over the API client and the projections behind every figure the
dashboard shows. A bug in those is a wrong number on a security operator's
screen rather than a visible crash, which is why they are tested apart from the
pages that render them.

## The rest of the system

| Repository | What it is |
|---|---|
| [zonegate-backend](https://github.com/ZoneGate/zonegate-backend) | The authorization API, policy engine and evidence gateway |
| **zonegate-website** | This console |
| [zonegate-mobile](https://github.com/ZoneGate/zonegate-mobile) | The field app, where an authorization is requested |

The console reads and writes live API data -- decisions, the actor roster and
the policy thresholds. With no backend reachable it says so in the header
rather than rendering an empty dashboard.

## Requirements

To run without Docker, make sure the following tools are installed:

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm

You can check your installed versions with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Then navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd zonegate-web
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install all dependencies defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the required packages, including Next.js, React, Lucide React, and Recharts.

> You do not need to manually copy or share the `node_modules` directory. It will be generated automatically by `npm install`.

### 3. Start the development server

Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After the server starts, open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

in your browser.

## Available Pages

| Page | Route |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | `/` |
| Requests | `/requests` |
| Couriers / Employees | `/employees` |
| Statistics | `/statistics` |
| Settings | `/settings` |

## Development

The project uses the Next.js App Router.

Main application pages are located under:

```text
src/app/
```

Shared interface components such as the sidebar and header are located under:

```text
src/components/
```

When the development server is running, changes to the source files are automatically reflected in the browser.

## Build

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the production build locally:

```bash
npm start
```

## Linting

To check the project for linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## UI

The ZoneGate interface follows a security-oriented enterprise dashboard design.

Primary interface colors:

```text
Primary:   #0D9488
Secondary: #0F172A
Accent:    #1FD1A8
Background:#F8FAFC
```

Decision states are represented as:

- **APPROVE** — verified authorization
- **HOLD** — requires additional or human review
- **DENY** — authorization rejected

## Current Development Status

The current version focuses on the frontend dashboard and interface flow.

Dashboard data is currently represented using mock data for UI development and demonstration purposes. Backend services, real-time network evidence, authentication, and production authorization workflows can be integrated separately.

## Notes

Do not commit sensitive configuration or credentials to the repository.

Files such as the following should remain excluded from Git:

```text
node_modules/
.next/
.env
.env.local
```

Environment variables and API credentials should be stored locally using environment files and must not be committed to the repository.
